# Delhi_Metro_Prototype

This is a Delhi Metro Map Prototype which asks the user to input the source and destination stations on the basis of the list provided, and returns the shortest path from the source to the destination, along with the total distance covered. It further asks the user to enter '1' to check the route between different sources and destinations and enter any other key to simply terminate the process. The project uses Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm (priority queue) to implement the said purpose. For the graph, 33 stations have been taken from the central part of the metro network, starting from Kashmere Gate.

The list of stations is as follows:

0:  Kashmere Gate
